Sunil Pai explores why some developers thrive with coding agents while others struggle. His key insight: LLMs are "thought completers" that traverse idea-space, so success depends on good navigation through constraints, context, oracles, and loops.

Using Steven Johnson's "Where Good Ideas Come From" as a framework, the article maps those principles onto coding agents and discusses:
- How to navigate the space of possibilities effectively
- Why constraints and context matter for getting good results
- How "juniors" can adapt to this new paradigm
- What "creating software" looks like in practice with AI assistance

## Key Takeaways

- LLMs work best as "thought completers" rather than autonomous problem solvers
- Good navigation requires: constraints (narrow the search space), context (provide relevant information), oracles (validation mechanisms), and loops (iteration)
- The gap between users who "cook" with agents vs those who "bounce off" comes down to how well they navigate the idea-space
- Junior developers need to level up their ability to provide good constraints and context
- Software creation is shifting from pure implementation to effective navigation and validation
