## Overview

Lee Robinson describes how AI agents have dramatically improved the product feedback loop, making it possible to automate the entire customer issue resolution workflow within days/weeks rather than weeks/months.

## The Evolution: Before and After

### Original Product Loop (from quoted thread)
1. Ship something
2. Make it easy to give feedback
3. Route feedback to the team
4. Fix their issue
5. Follow up with the customer
6. Repeat forever ∞

### Modern AI-Powered Automation

Now dramatically easier with the right infrastructure:

1. **Automated Issue Resolution**: Send all customer feedback to a coding agent and have it attempt to fix the issue automatically
2. **High-Quality Context**: Give the agent comprehensive data sources (logs, error messages, etc.) so it can dig deeper and reproduce issues
3. **Validation Testing**: Equip the agent with a computer/environment to test and validate its own work before deployment
4. **Automatic Follow-up**: Build automated workflows to follow up with customers via email or DM once the error is fixed—no forgetting!

## Ingestion Improvements

The intake process is also much easier now:
- Dump a single tweet into a Slack channel
- AI automatically enriches the error report
- System saves customer details
- Fixes start immediately

## Key Insight

"Only the best products will survive. Adjust accordingly!"

The speed of the feedback loop is now a primary competitive advantage. Teams that can close the feedback-to-fix-to-followup cycle fastest will dominate their markets.

## Implementation Considerations

- Need robust feedback intake channels (Twitter, Slack, email, etc.)
- Require high-quality error/log data for agents to work with
- Need sandboxed testing environments for agent validation
- Require notification infrastructure for automatic customer follow-ups
