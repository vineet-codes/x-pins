**Source:** https://socialskillswisdom.com/
**Author:** Dale Carnegie (original), unrevised edition
**Category:** Self-Help / Social Skills / Personal Development

## Overview

The original, unrevised edition of Dale Carnegie's classic "How to Win Friends and Influence People." This version contains material that was heavily edited out of later editions by Carnegie's feminist wife and daughter after his death.

## Key Historical Note

The book underwent significant revisions after Dale Carnegie's death. His wife and daughter edited the manuscript to make it more politically correct for modern audiences, removing content they deemed outdated or inappropriate. The unrevised edition represents Carnegie's original work before these editorial changes.

## Notable Difference

According to those who have compared versions, the unrevised edition includes **8 complete chapters dealing with relationships and how to approach women** that were completely deleted from later versions. These chapters represent Carnegie's original advice on interpersonal dynamics that was deemed unsuitable for revision.

## Accessibility

The unrevised edition is available through the Social Skills Wisdom website and other sources dedicated to preserving the original text.

## Value

For those interested in:
- Dale Carnegie's original philosophy
- Historical perspective on social advice
- Complete, unedited wisdom on human relations
- Original perspectives on gender dynamics and relationships
