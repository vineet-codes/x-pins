# Claude Teacher: A Better Way to Learn Through Projects

Zara Zhang proposes turning Claude Code projects into learning experiences by creating detailed documentation files for each project.

## The Core Idea

For every project, write a detailed **FOR[yourname].md** file that explains the whole project in plain language. This transforms a completed project into a comprehensive learning resource.

## What to Include in FOR[yourname].md

1. **Technical Architecture**: Overview of the system design and how it works
2. **Codebase Structure**: How the various parts of the codebase are connected and organized
3. **Technologies Used**: Stack and tools employed
4. **Technical Decisions**: Why you made specific technical choices
5. **Lessons Learned**: Including:
   - Bugs you ran into and how you fixed them
   - Potential pitfalls and how to avoid them in the future
   - New technologies discovered during the project
6. **Engineering Insights**: How good engineers think and work
7. **Best Practices**: Patterns and approaches that worked well

## Writing Style

The documentation should be **very engaging to read** - not boring technical documentation or textbook material. Where appropriate:
- Use analogies to make complex concepts understandable
- Share anecdotes from the development process
- Make it memorable and enjoyable to learn from

## Why This Matters

This approach transforms Claude Code from a tool for shipping products into a **teaching and learning platform**. Every project becomes an educational artifact that captures not just what was built, but how to think about building.

## Key Insight

"Every project is a lesson to become more technical." By documenting your thinking, decisions, and lessons learned, you create a personal knowledge base that helps you become a better engineer over time.
