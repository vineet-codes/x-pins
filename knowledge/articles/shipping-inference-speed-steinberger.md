Why I stopped reading code and started watching it stream by. Peter Steinberger shares insights from his Clawdbot project, exploring the philosophical shift from traditional code review to watching AI agents generate code in real-time. The article contrasts different approaches to AI-assisted development, examining why some developers prefer Codex over Claude Code for certain workflows.

## Key Takeaways

- The paradigm shift from reading/writing code to observing AI-generated code streams
- Real-time code generation changes how developers think about shipping velocity
- Different AI tools have different strengths for agentic development (Codex vs Claude Code)
- Clawdbot project demonstrates practical agentic development patterns
- Inference speed directly impacts development workflow and team dynamics
