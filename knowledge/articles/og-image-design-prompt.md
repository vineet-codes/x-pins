## Overview

A comprehensive prompt template for creating premium open-graph hero images using Nano Banana Pro or similar image generation tools. The prompt guides creation of a high-end designer mockup (16:9 ratio) suitable for social sharing, website headers, and marketing collateral.

## Key Design Elements

### Layout Structure
- Split composition into two clear zones with generous breathing room
- **Left Zone**: Brand logo in top-left corner (appropriately sized), followed by single large headline (3-6 words max) in clean modern sans-serif, left-aligned
- **Right Zone**: One floating, rounded rectangular panel suggesting product interface or dashboard with subtle depth

### Negative Space Strategy
- Strong use of negative space throughout
- Clean, uncluttered background
- Clear visual breathing room between text block and interface panel
- Nothing feels cramped or crowded

### Color & Style
- Colors drawn from the [BRAND] palette
- Background can be brand color, white, off-white, or subtle gradient
- Overall style is flat or near-flat
- No heavy gradients, glossy effects, or 3D renders
- Subtle shadows for gentle depth only
- Modern, confident, legible typography

### Mood & Feel
- Clean SaaS homepage hero aesthetic
- Quiet confidence
- Premium, polished, and intentional feel
- Every element placed with purpose

## What to Avoid
- Stock photo elements
- People in the image
- Complex illustrations or decorative graphics/patterns
- Multiple interface panels
- Visual noise
- Text other than headline and brand name
- Borders or frames around the image

## Output Specifications
- Single 16:9 image format
- No watermarks
- No mockup frames
- No external branding
- Ready to use as: open-graph image, social header, or presentation slide

## Use Case
