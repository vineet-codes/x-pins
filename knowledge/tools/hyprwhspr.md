## Overview

A native speech-to-text solution for Arch/Omarchy systems that uses CPU-backed base models. Noted by David Heinemeier Hansson (@dhh) as exceptionally accurate for local model dictation, performing impressively fast despite using only base CPU models.

## Key Features

- Local speech-to-text processing (no cloud dependency)
- Works with base models on CPU
- High accuracy transcription
- Native support for Arch/Omarchy systems
- Fast performance

## Notable Endorsement

David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) praised the tool for its impressive accuracy and speed, noting he was "blown away" by how well the base CPU model performs for dictation tasks.

## Use Cases

- Local, privacy-preserving speech-to-text
- Offline dictation
- Fast voice input for Arch/Omarchy environments
