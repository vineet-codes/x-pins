## Overview

Smaug is a JavaScript tool that archives Twitter/X bookmarks to markdown format automatically. It's designed like a dragon hoarding treasure - collecting and organizing the valuable things you bookmark.

## New Feature: Likes Support

Alex Hillman has added support for Twitter likes in addition to bookmarks. Users can now choose to:
- Archive bookmarks (default)
- Archive likes
- Archive both bookmarks and likes

This follows similar functionality added to other bookmark tools like Bird.

## Key Features

- Automatically archives Twitter/X bookmarks to markdown
- Now supports likes in addition to bookmarks
- Flexible configuration for which items to archive
- 371 GitHub stars
- Open source

## Context

This update is part of the broader ecosystem of tools being built around social media curation and personal knowledge management. The addition of likes support makes Smaug more flexible for users who rely on Twitter's like feature instead of bookmarks for saving content.
