DeepTutor is an open-source AI-powered learning assistant that adapts to individual learning styles through persistent memory and multi-agent collaboration. Released just five days ago, it surged past 1.4K stars (now 2,125+), indicating strong demand for intelligent tutoring systems.

## Core Problem

Existing AI learning tools are either too fragmented or fail to capture personal learning context effectively. Students need an AI companion that remembers their progress and adapts to their unique learning style.

## Core Architecture

### User Interface Layer
Intuitive bidirectional interaction with structured, actionable outputs that organize complex context seamlessly.

### Intelligent Agent Modules
Specialized multi-agent collaboration system with four key agents:
- **Problem Solving Agent**: Multi-agent problem solving with RAG, web search, and code execution. Delivers step-by-step solutions with precise citations.
- **Deep Research Agent**: Comprehensive topic exploration with systematic analysis. Identifies patterns, connects related concepts across disciplines, synthesizes research findings.
- **Guided Learning Agent**: Transforms complex concepts into visual aids, step-by-step breakdowns, and interactive demonstrations.
- **Idea Generation Agent**: Generates structured learning materials and uncovers knowledge gaps. Identifies promising research directions through cross-domain synthesis.

### Tool Integration Layer
Unified access to:
- RAG retrieval
- Real-time web search
- Academic databases
- Code execution capabilities

### Personalized Knowledge & Memory Foundation
Persistent memory system built on knowledge graphs with contextual session tracking. Creates truly personalized learning experiences tailored to individual progress and preferences.
