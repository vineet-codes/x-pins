A systematic workflow for capturing, categorizing, and managing ideas without getting lost in decision paralysis. Designed to help people with ADHD-like ideation patterns convert bursts of creativity into actionable projects.

## Key Concept

The "plant seed" metaphor describes a two-phase approach:
1. **Plant**: Capture raw ideas with minimal friction, gathering context from recent conversations and decisions
2. **Surface**: Let the system decide when ideas should be revisited based on readiness factors

Ideas are filed based on three key metrics:
- **Readiness**: Is the foundation solid enough to start building?
- **Impact**: How significant would the outcome be?
- **Effort**: What's the time/resource investment required?

## Benefits

- Prevents good ideas from being forgotten or lost
- Removes the need to remember context later
- Automates decision-making about when to build
- Reduces context switching overhead
- Converts ideation bursts into a managed backlog

## Use Case

Perfect for anyone who experiences rapid idea generation but struggles with:
- Remembering ideas after moving to the next task
- Deciding which ideas are worth building
- Preventing context loss when revisiting old ideas
- Managing a high volume of potential projects
