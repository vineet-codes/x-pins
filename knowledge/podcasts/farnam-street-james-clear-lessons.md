## Key Lesson Categories

### Identity & Behavior (Lessons 1, 5, 26)
- Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become
- The tighter you cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it
- Fix the mindset before optimizing the system

### Consistency & Patience (Lessons 3, 7, 16, 28)
- The cost of good habits is in the present; the cost of bad habits is in the future
- Intensity makes for a good story; consistency makes for good results
- A lack of patience changes the outcome
- The fastest way to stop learning is to believe you already know it

### Work & Optimization (Lessons 2, 4, 8, 13, 23, 33)
- You cannot outwork the person working on a better thing
- Prioritize work that keeps working for you once it's done
- Do the obvious things first; that gets you 80% of the way there
- Success isn't 10,000 attempts; it's 10,000 iterations—try differently, not just harder
- If your actions are not oriented toward your goal, they're not accumulating
- Move like thunder: do fewer things, but with impact that cannot be ignored

### Strategy & Preparation (Lessons 9, 18, 22, 34)
- Live in two timeframes: 10 years and one hour
- The most powerful form of preparation is a mindset that can handle uncertainty
- To start, you only need points A, B, and Z; you don't need to see steps C through Y
- Find ways to visualize your progress

### Environment & Friction (Lessons 6, 11, 12, 21)
- Shape your environment with friction: make hard things harder, easy things easier
- Use your current advantages to gain new advantages
- The work is not being wasted; it's being stored
- The heaviest weight at the gym is the front door

### Knowledge & Growth (Lessons 24, 29, 30, 42)
- Almost every thought you have is downstream from what you consume
- Knowledge is about the past, but decisions are about the future
- The desire to belong often overpowers the desire to understand
- If you want to be a better writer, read more

### Luck & Opportunity (Lessons 19, 25, 37, 39)
- You don't know when the break will come, but if you keep creating surface area, luck will eventually find you
- Just because improvements aren't noticeable doesn't mean improvement isn't happening
- Your first idea is not your best idea
- Outcome over ego

### Business & Wealth (Lessons 14, 15, 35, 36, 38, 40, 41)
- The quest for novelty overpowers the desire for results
- When something's working, we underestimate how long it can go for
- The goal is not to beat the market; the goal is to end up wealthy
- Reputation takes care of itself if you take care of other people
- We crave the status as much as we crave the outcome
- People want to believe there's a secret; there isn't
- The only bad mindset is the one you're fixed in

### Mindset & Wisdom (Lessons 10, 17, 20, 44, 45, 46)
- Don't be the first to tell yourself no; let the world tell you no first
- If you're not outthinking them, you're not outworking them
- It is highly unlikely that whatever you are working on right now is the best use of your time
- So many problems in life come from your brain over-emphasizing minor details that don't matter
- Success is having power over my days
- Don't waste the reader's time

### Frameworks & Optimization (Lessons 27, 31, 32, 43)
- You don't want to compete with the person having fun
- Habits are the repeated solutions to recurring problems
- Broad funnel, tight filter
- Maintain a positive mental attitude regardless of current circumstances
