## @threepointone - Where Good Ideas Come From (for Coding Agents)

> new post: where good ideas come from (for coding agents) https://t.co/CwE393F8rz
>
> thought about why some people cook with coding agents, and others bounce off. my take: llms are "thought completers" traversing idea-space - so good results come from good navigation: constraints, context, oracles, loops. I used steven johnson's "where good ideas come" from as a rubric and mapped it onto coding agents. also a note about how "juniors" can adapt to this new feature, and what "creating software" looks like practically.
